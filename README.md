# Dataset :  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images?select=Data

# Problem Statement : 
  The current manual analysis of CT-Scan images for lung health assessment is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. An automated system using deep learning techniques is needed to improve accuracy, speed, and consistency in lung health classification, enhancing overall diagnostic efficiency and patient care.

# Objective : 
  The objective is to implement and evaluate multiple deep learning models, including CNN, ResNet, and DenseNet, to classify lung CT-Scan images into four categories, and identify the most effective algorithm for accurate lung condition detection.

# Four Categories : 
  1. Adenocarcinoma
  2. Large Cell Carcinoma
  3. Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  4. Normal.

# Models used : 
  1. Convolutional neural network (CNN) - Achieved an accuracy of 56%.
  2. DenseNet. - Achieved an accuracy of 90%.
